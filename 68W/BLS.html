            ],
            answer: 2,
            explanation: "Knowing your limitations is a key element of team dynamics. You must inform the leader so they can reassign the task.",
            cite: "Team Dynamics"
        },
        {
            q: "Which of the following is an example of 'Closed-Loop Communication'?",

                "The team leader says 'Give 1mg Epi' and you say nothing but do it",
                "The team leader says 'Give 1mg Epi' and you reply 'Giving 1mg Epi now'",
                "You tell the team leader 'I think we should shock'",
                "The team leader yells 'Clear!'"
            ],
            answer: 1,
            explanation: "Closed-loop communication involves repeating the order back to the leader to confirm it was heard and understood before executing.",
            cite: "Communication Skills"
        },
        {
            q: "The team leader notices a compressor is not allowing full chest recoil. What is the best way to address this?",
            options: [
                "Yell 'Stop!' immediately",
                "Say constructively, 'I noticed you are leaning on the chest; please allow full recoil.'",

            ],
            answer: 1,

        {

            ],
            answer: 2,

            cite: "Opioid Algorithm"
        },
        {
            q: "In a cardiac arrest suspected to be caused by opioid overdose, does Naloxone administration take priority over CPR?",
            options: [
                "Yes, Naloxone fixes the cause",
                "No, High-Quality CPR and Defibrillation are the priority",
                "Yes, but only if you have an IV",
                "No, you should never give Naloxone in arrest"
            ],
            answer: 1,
            explanation: "CPR and AED use take priority. Naloxone can be administered, but do not interrupt high-quality CPR to do it.",
            cite: "Opioid Associated Arrest"
        },
        {
            q: "You have administered one dose of Naloxone to a respiratory arrest patient. There is no response after 2-3 minutes. What should you do?",

            ],
            answer: 1,
            explanation: "CCF is the % of time spent actually compressing. High-performance teams aim for >80% to maximize perfusion.",
            cite: "High-Performance CPR"
        },
        {
            q: "Why is hyperventilation (giving too many breaths) dangerous during cardiac arrest?",
            options: [
                "It wakes the patient up too fast",
                "It increases intrathoracic pressure, decreasing venous return to the heart",
                "It causes the lungs to pop",
                "It cools the body down"
            ],
            answer: 1,
            explanation: "Too much pressure in the chest prevents blood from returning to the heart, which lowers the effectiveness of your compressions.",
